## What is this?

This utility lets you find one or many files upwards.

## When should I use this?

You can use this utility if you want to find, say, a config file.
If you instead want to find files downwards, such as all markdown files in a
folder, you can use [`vfile-find-down`][vfile-find-down].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 14.14+ and 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-find-up
```

## Use

```js
import {findUpAll} from 'vfile-find-up'

console.log(await findUpAll('package.json'))
```

Yields:

```js
[ VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: [ '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-up/package.json' ],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-up' } ]
```

## API

This package exports the identifiers [`findUp`][api-find-up] and
[`findUpAll`][api-find-up-all].
There is no default export.

### `findUp(test[, path][, callback])`

Find the first file or folder upwards.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: files are not read (their `value` is not populated).

###### Signatures

*   `(test[, path], callback) => undefined`
*   `(test[, path]) => Promise<VFile>`

###### Parameters

*   `test` ([`Test`][api-test])
    â€” things to search for
*   `path` (`string`, default: `process.cwd()`)
    â€” place to search from
*   `callback` ([`Callback`][api-callback], optional)
    â€” callback called when done

###### Returns

Nothing when `callback` is given (`undefined`), otherwise a promise that
resolves to a file ([`VFile | undefined`][vfile]).

### `findUpAll(test[, path][, callback])`

Find files or folders upwards.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: files are not read (their `value` is not populated).

###### Signatures

*   `(test[, path], callback) => undefined`
*   `(test[, path]) => Promise<Array<VFile>>`

###### Parameters

*   `test` ([`Test`][api-test])
    â€” things to search for
*   `paths` (`string`, default: `process.cwd()`)
    â€” place to search from
*   `callback` ([`CallbackAll`][api-callback-all], optional)
    â€” callback called when done

###### Returns

Nothing when `callback` is given (`undefined`), otherwise a promise that
resolves to files ([`Array<VFile>`][vfile]).

### `Assert`

Handle a file (TypeScript type).

###### Parameters

*   `file` ([`VFile`][vfile])
    â€” file to handle

###### Returns

How to handle this file ([`Result`][api-result], optional).

### `Callback`

Callback called when done finding one file (TypeScript type).

###### Parameters

*   `error` (`Error | undefined`)
    â€” error; errors are currently never passed
*   `file` ([`VFile | undefined`][vfile])
    â€” file

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

### `CallbackAll`

Callback called when done (TypeScript type).

###### Parameters

*   `error` (`Error | undefined`)
    â€” error; errors are currently never passed
*   `files` ([`Array<VFile>`][vfile])
    â€” files

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

### `Result`

What to do when collecting a file or folder (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `break` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    â€” stop searching after this file or folder
*   `include` (`boolean`, default: `false`)
    â€” include this file or folder

### `Test`

Things to search for (TypeScript type).

For strings, the `basename` or `extname` of files must match them.
For arrays, any test in them must match.

###### Type

```ts
type Test = Array<Assert | string> | Assert | string
```

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types
[`Assert`][api-assert],
[`Callback`][api-callback],
[`CallbackAll`][api-callback-all],
[`Result`][api-result], and
[`Test`][api-test].
