## What is this?

This utility lets you find one or many files upwards.

## When should I use this?

You can use this utility if you want to find, say, a config file.
If you instead want to find files downwards, such as all markdown files in a
folder, you can use [`vfile-find-down`][vfile-find-down].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, or 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-find-up
```

## Use

```js
import {findUp} from 'vfile-find-up'

console.log(await findUp('package.json'))
```

Yields:

```js
[ VFile {
  data: {},
  messages: [],
  history: [ '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-up/package.json' ],
  cwd: '/Users/tilde/projects/oss/vfile-find-up' } ]
```

## API

This package exports the identifiers `findUp`, `findUpOne`, `INCLUDE`, and
`BREAK`.
There is no default export.

### `findUp(tests[, path][, callback])`

Search for `tests` upwards.
Calls callback with either an error or an array of files passing `tests`.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: files are not read (their `value` is not populated).

##### Sigantures

*   `(tests: Test, path?: string, callback: Callback): void`
*   `(tests: Test, path?: string): Promise<Array<VFile>>`

##### Parameters

###### `tests`

Things to search for (`string`, `Function`, or `Array<tests>`).

If a `string` is passed in, the `basename` or `extname` of files must match it
for them to be included.

If an array is passed in, any test must match a given file for it to be
included.

Otherwise, they must be [`Assert`][assert].

###### `path`

Place to searching from (`string`, default: `process.cwd()`).

###### `callback`

Function called with all matching files (`function cb(error[, files])`).

### `findUpOne(tests[, path][, callback])`

Like `findUp`, but either calls `callback` with the first found file or `null`,
or returns a promise that resolved to a file or `null`.

### `function assert(file)`

Check whether a virtual file should be included.
Called with a [vfile][].

##### Returns

*   `true` or `INCLUDE` â€” include the file in the results
*   `BREAK` â€” stop searching for files
*   anything else is ignored: the file is not included

The different flags can be combined by using the pipe operator:
`INCLUDE | BREAK`.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types `Assert` and `Test`.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
